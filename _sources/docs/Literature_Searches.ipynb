Reading scientific publications from others helps you understand the technical topics that are relevant to your work, but also give you experience in how to effectively communicate scientific findings. If your project is very successful and you are motivated to write then you might even be able to help write a new contribution to the scientific literature through this course!"

    "### Absolute Searches\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use databases such as [Web of Science](https://apps.webofknowledge.com/WOS_GeneralSearch_input.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&SID=4EfVjR2mo9oBIcGKmob&preferencesSaved=) and/or [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search for terms that you think are relevant to your interest\n",
    "\t- Use quotation marks and \"wildcard\" characters (*, ?)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Start with a review paper or a few very relevant papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go through references list, particularly introductory references.\n",
    "\t- Use [Crossref Metadata search](http://search.crossref.org/) to find articles from citations.\n",
    "\t- Some journal sites will have links to cited works.\n",
    "\t- Look for commonly cited authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many journal websites will have a \"cited by\" column. This can be very valuable.\n",
    "\n",

    "### AI-Powered Searching\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a new (as of 2023) and powerful but dangerous tool. There are many emerging tools that claim to use artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate literature searches. Some seem promising, but others fail miserably. I strongly recommend getting familiar with the basic \"manual\" search strategies above before venturing into these, but I realize that the allure is very strong. Here I will highlight two tools: one that works reasonably well, and one that fails in the most dangerous possible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) - This AI-powered search is connected to the internet, which allows it to generally find references. A good strategy is to ask it to `Write a well-referenced paragraph about...` which gives some context along with citations. Note that many of them will not be peer-reviewed, but some may, and it can help you navigate the jargon of an unfamiliar field. However, you should ***always*** carefully review any reference yourself before citing it to ensure that the tool did not make a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ChatGPT - This AI tool made large language models famous, but it is a terrible failure at searching the literature. It will make up very convincing references that simply do not exist. If you tell it they don't exist, it will apologize and make up some more. This process can be repeated ad nauseum, but in my experience it has never found a real useful reference. These \"false positives\" are very dangerous in AI-powered literature searches, so proceed with caution."
