This is also partially educational research, and we will send out various surveys throughout the semester. The bot, named \"ChatDFT-F24\" will be accessible via Slack, and is based off of ChatGPT. This semester, all projects will involve performing DFT simulations with the aid of ChatDFT to study reproducibility in DFT and how LLMs can assist in performing scientific computing tasks. Note that all converations with ChatDFT will be recorded and may be reviewed and/or used for fine-tuning or development of future versions of ChatDFT. We also appreciate any feedback you have about ChatDFT, including best practices for prompt engineering, ideas about how to improve the architecture, or various failure modes that you experience. The tool is far from perfect, and like any LLM it should not be blindly trusted!\n",

This code is very powerful, but relatively new, and thus not as familiar for LLM tools. We hope that through this project we can help tailor an LLM interface that allows new users to quickly learn to use SPARC to perform reliable calculations."

DFT software packages are well-established, but require the use of supercomputing resources and must be converged with respect to several numerical parameters.

    "- There are several sub-teams, each of which will function as a small research group advised by a graduate mentor. The main tasks in each sub-team will be calculation of adsorption energies, but each team will focus on different systems and mentors may focus on different aspects (e.g. reproducibility, accuracy at different levels of theory, etc.).\n",
    "    * **Simulation of transition metal surfaces (led by Neung-Kyung Yu)** - Transition metals are some of the most common catalysts, and adsorption on transition metals has been widely studied. However, there are still open questions about the accuracy of these models since adsorption energies are difficult to measure, and the vast literature provides lots of opportunities to study reproducibility. This team will focus on calculating some well-known adsorption energies and evaluating accuracy and reproducibility.\n",
    "    * **Adsorption on electrochemical oxide surfaces (led by Kaylee Tian)** - Electrochemistry and electrocatalysis are promising sustainable alternatives for a wide range of processes including fuel production and waste treatment. However, calculating adsorption energies on oxides can be challenging due to complex electronic structure (magnetism, localized electrons) and the fact that many metal oxides are highly reactive and can change under reaction conditions. This team will focus on the influence of different atomic configurations of oxide surfaces and different DFT settings and initializations on the adsorption energies of intermediates related to electrocatalytric nutrient recovery from waste sludge.\n",
    "    * **Simulations of Nano-porous Materials (led by Lucas Timmerman)** - This team will focus on electronic structure theory (EST) calculations for zeolites and metal organic frameworks. These will primarily consist of adsorption energy calculations for materials and adsorbates of interest for sustainability applications, including direct air capture and biomass conversion. Outcomes include basic proficiency in EST calculations as well as a fundamental understanding of the chemistry and physics concepts underpinning at least one of the materials listed above.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Students should work on self-defined individual tasks within the scope of a sub-team\n",
    "    * Each student should have a clearly-defined task that they are working independently on. This task should be self-determined and within the scope of the broader goal of the sub-team based on consultations with other sub-team members and the graduate student advisor.\n",
    "    * Students may work together on a given task or direction, but should also have individual goals.\n",
    "    * Students should regularly communicate with their sub-team to (1) coordinate progress on individual tasks to work toward the larger goal of the team, (2) ask for and provide assistance to other sub-team members, and (3) seek advice from and provide updates to the sub-team graduate mentor.\n",
    "    * It is fully expected that the goals of research tasks change throughout the semester. The goals document can be updated at any time up to 2 weeks prior to the end of the semester. Students should revise goals as needed to ensure they are achievable.\n",
    "    * Note that the achievements grade is determined by your sub-team advisor. Different advisors may have different expectations and organizational standards. You should be sure to clearly communicate with your subteam advisor to be sure that you are meeting their expectations."
