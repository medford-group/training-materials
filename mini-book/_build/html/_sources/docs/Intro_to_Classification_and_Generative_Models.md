# Intro to Classification and Generative Models

## Introduction

In part two of our intro to data science and ML, we turn to focusing on classification and generative models. Classification models are useful for identifying group membership or analyzing high dimensional data qualitatively. Generative models are becoming increasingly popular (both in the context of LLM for speech and in chemistry for predicting structures). Here we introduce some simpler models that are useful for understanding the concepts of classification and generative models.
