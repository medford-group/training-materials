    "# Running a simple DFT calculation on PACE Supercomputer Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will learn about running DFT calculations on PACE. We will first learn about SLURM submission scripts that are used to submit jobs on PACE. As a member of Medford group, you will have access to two supercomputer clusters here at Georgia Tech: PACE-Phoenix and PACE-Hive. If you are part of the VIP course, you will have access to PACE-ICE cluster. You shouldn't use \"#SBATCH -A gts-amedford6-joe\" if you are on PACE-ICE which is requesting resources from your PI's account. If you are on PACE-Phoenix, you will need to request for resources from your PI's account. This means that you are paying for the jobs you are running therefore, these resources should be used judiciously. **Note** Any code block beginning wih `#!/bin/bash` indicates bash commands or a bash script. All other code should be assumed to be python. An example run.sh script to submit a SPARC job is given below:"

    "To submit a job to the SLURM system, you have to use the **sbatch** command. We usually call this file run.sbatch for convenience. The command for submitting the job will be **sbatch run.sbatch**. When you do this, you are essentially handing the file to the SLURM queuing system which will scan the file for the blocks containing #SBATCH that specify the resources you are requesting for the job. Each line in this file starting with #SBATCH specifies something different. The line with tag **-N** are requesting certain resources (nodes and processors per node). You can request the resources based on requirement of your calculations. In this example script, we are requesting for 1 node and 8 processors per node. The next line (#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3G) specifies the memory you request per processor. Here it is 3 GB. Hence the total memory we request for is 24 GB. For Phoenix cluster, the default queue is *inferno* where the jobs are run. -J is the name you want to give the job, -o and -e are the filenames where the outputs and errors will be printed respectively. You can run *pace-whoami* check the maximum resources available for a particular queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are submitting a job to PACE-HIVE, you will need to specify the queue using **#SBATCH -q**. HIVE has different queues like hive, hive-himem, hive-interact which offer different resources and walltime. After the SBATCH block, you can source your environment and run the code. The next line with change directory (cd) command with an alias for current working directory (SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR) changes to the correct folder. More information about SLURM script and submission of jobs on PACE can be found in this [link](https://pace.gatech.edu/pace-user-documentation). "

If you choose to use the intel compiler then you will need add `-no-multibyte-chars` to the line that starts with `CFLAGS`. When running SPARC, you will need to `module load` the same compiler that you used for compilation. When possible, we also recommend loading specific modules. E.g., `ml anaconda3` loads a deafault from one of several versions of anaconda available. These defaults are liabale to change (without notice) and cause your code to break. Thus, it is preferable to `ml anaconda3/2022.05` If this module ever becomes unavailable, you will know because this will break!
