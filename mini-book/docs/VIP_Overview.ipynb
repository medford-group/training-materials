Team members range from sophomores through graduate students, from first-time participants to students who have been involved for four or more semesters. Some students take the course for one credit, and others take it for two credits; naturally, the bar will be higher for those taking it for two credits.\n"

    "This semester, we are starting to work on a new large-language model (LLM) based tool that we hope will make it easier for students to learn how to do DFT calculations. This is also partially educational research, and we will send out various surveys throughout the semester. The bot, named \"ChatDFT\" will be accessible via Slack, and is based off of ChatGPT. This semester, all projects will involve performing DFT simulations with the aid of ChatDFT to study reproducibility in DFT and how LLMs can assist in performing scientific computing tasks. Note that all converations with ChatDFT will be recorded and may be reviewed and/or used for fine-tuning or development of future versions of ChatDFT. We also appreciate any feedback you have about ChatDFT, including best practices for prompt engineering, ideas about how to improve the architecture, or various failure modes that you experience. The tool is far from perfect, and like any LLM it should not be blindly trusted!\n",

    "All subteams will also work with the SPARC DFT code, a recent DFT package developed by Prof. Suryanarayana at Georgia Tech, designed for massively parallel calculations. This code is very powerful, but relatively new, and thus not as familiar for LLM tools. We hope that through this project we can help tailor an LLM interface that allows new users to quickly learn to use SPARC to perform reliable calculations."

DFT software packages are well-established, but require the use of supercomputing resources and must be converged with respect to several numerical parameters. The training will cover approximately 10 weeks and is highly represnetative of training programs for new graduate students in this field."
