Team members range from sophomores through graduate students, from first-time participants to students who have been involved for four or more semesters. Some students take the course for one credit, and others take it for two credits; naturally, the bar will be higher for those taking it for two credits.\n"

This is also partially educational research, and we will send out various surveys throughout the semester. The bot, named \"ChatDFT\" will be accessible via Slack, and is based off of ChatGPT. This semester, all projects will involve performing DFT simulations with the aid of ChatDFT to study reproducibility in DFT and how LLMs can assist in performing scientific computing tasks. Note that all converations with ChatDFT will be recorded and may be reviewed and/or used for fine-tuning or development of future versions of ChatDFT. We also appreciate any feedback you have about ChatDFT, including best practices for prompt engineering, ideas about how to improve the architecture, or various failure modes that you experience. The tool is far from perfect, and like any LLM it should not be blindly trusted!\n",

We hope that through this project we can help tailor an LLM interface that allows new users to quickly learn to use SPARC to perform reliable calculations."

DFT software packages are well-established, but require the use of supercomputing resources and must be converged with respect to several numerical parameters. The training will cover approximately 10 weeks and is highly represnetative of training programs for new graduate students in this field."

    "## DFT adsorption energy reproducibility project\n",
    "This project will explore a crucial, but often neglected, aspect of DFT research: reproducibility of results. There are a few papers on this topic (e.g. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad3000) but none that focus specifically on adsorption energies. Since adsorption energies are \"derived quantities\" -- that is, they are not direct outputs of a single DFT calculation -- they can be more challenging to reproduce.\n",
    "Our hypothesis is that by combining large-language models with natural language instructions, we can identify how to more robustly communicate instructions about how to reproduce DFT calculations, and provide specific insight into which \"prompt engineering\" strategies and LLM structures that are most effective for the task. Your project will help test this hypothesis by using LLMs to reproduce at least 3 adsorption energies found in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading:\n",
    "The details of the project are outlined below. The project will count toward the \"Achievements\" grade, and will be graded based on the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Midterm:**\n",
    "* 5: Three adsorption energies reproduced to within 0.1 eV accuracy using the SPARC code.\n",
    "* 4: Two adsorption energies reproduced to within 0.1 eV accuracy using the SPARC code.\n",
    "* 3: One adsorption energy reproduced to within 0.1 eV accuracy using the SPARC code.\n",
    "* 2: No adsorption energy successfully reproduced, but significant effort made.\n",
    "* 1: No adsorption energy successfully reproduced, but some effort made.\n",
    "* 0: No effort made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final:**\n",
    "* 5: A set of LLM prompts that can be used with ChatDFT (or any other LLM of your choosing) to automatically set up input scripts for an adsorption energy calculation, demonstrated on at least one of the 3 examples.\n",
    "* 4: Clear recommendations on what information is needed to be included in Methods sections and LLM prompts to ensure reproducibility, with specific discussion of the 3 examples from the midterm.\n",
    "* 3: Three adsorption energies reproduced to within 0.1 eV accuracy using the SPARC code, and general commentary on how this was achieved.\n",
    "* 2: Two adsorption energies reproduced to within 0.1 eV accuracy using the SPARC code, and general commentary on how this was achieved.\n",
    "* 1: One adsorption energies reproduced to within 0.1 eV accuracy using the SPARC code, and general commentary on how this was achieved.\n",
    "* 0: No adsorption energies successfully reproduced.\n",
    "Note that the accuracy threshold assumes that there are no major reproducibility issues with the examples you selected. In cases where significant reproducibility issues are discovered, then it is only necessary to show that your own adsorption energy calculations are converged to a numerical accuracy of 0.05 eV.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "### Phase 1: Reproduce at least three adsorption energies from the literature using the SPARC code.\n",
    "This involves identifying three published adsorption energies from one or multiple papers of your choosing. Selecting different papers will be more challenging, but you will also learn more in the process. You should then use all information provided in the \"Methods\" and \"Supplementary Material\" (or other) sections of the publication to attempt to reproduce the adsorption energy using the SPARC DFT code. It is expected that the \"numerical error\" associated with this should be below 0.1 eV as long as there are no issues with the published results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that to do this thoroughly you will need to re-calculate the lattice constants with SPARC to ensure that they are self-consistent throughout. The process will also involve translating different keywords and numerical techniques between whatever code was used in the published results and SPARC. You can and should consult graduate student mentors, \"ChatDFT\", or other AI assistants in this process.\n",
    "The deliverable for the midterm is a ~2 page report detailing what you learned in this process, and all input files needed to reproduce the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Using AI to enhance reproducibility.\n",
    "In this phase, you will revisit the process of reproducing adsorption energy calculations and attempt to \"formalize\" it into a clear set of natural language prompts or instructions that can be used to have an AI model reliably reproduce the results. For the purpose of this project you only need to focus on reproducibility with the SPARC code, but as an additional challenge you can consider what would need to be modified to make it general to other codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend first exploring the \"ChatDFT\" model for this process, but note that you are welcome to explore other alternatives that you have access to. If this process is successful, we are particularly interested in how it could be translated to a smaller LLM that could be run as a stand-alone inference model on a standard CPU. For those interested in LLM development, this may be an interesting question to pursue.\n",
    "    \n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each student should have a clearly-defined task that they are working independently on. This task should be self-determined and within the scope of the broader goal of the sub-team based on consultations with other sub-team members and the graduate student advisor.\n",
    "* Students may work together on a given task or direction, but should also have individual goals.\n",
    "* Students should regularly communicate with their sub-team to (1) coordinate progress on individual tasks to work toward the larger goal of the team, (2) ask for and provide assistance to other sub-team members, and (3) seek advice from and provide updates to the sub-team graduate mentor.\n",
    "* It is fully expected that the goals of research tasks change throughout the semester. The goals document can be updated at any time up to 2 weeks prior to the end of the semester. Students should revise goals as needed to ensure they are achievable.\n",
    "* Note that the achievements grade is determined by your sub-team advisor. Different advisors may have different expectations and organizational standards. You should be sure to clearly communicate with your subteam advisor to be sure that you are meeting their expectations."
